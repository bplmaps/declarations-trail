  From letters to plays and poetry to history, Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Adams,
  and Phillis Wheatley communicated ideas about revolution, independence, and
  freedom. They engaged leading political figures, family members, and peers in
  conversations about women’s rights, slavery, and the future of American
  government. Join us to discover how Warren, Adams, and Wheatley wrote their
  way through the American Revolution and beyond. 
   
  Before the program, join us for a reception and mingle with historical
  interpreters who bring to life the stories of Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail
  Adams, Phillis Wheatley, and Martha Washington.
