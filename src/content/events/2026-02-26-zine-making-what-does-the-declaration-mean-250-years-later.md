title: "Zine Making: What Does the Declaration Mean 250 Years Later?"
snippet: >-
  This year marks the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
  Independence. Through an art-making opportunity, reflect on what the document
  means 250 years later and how the American Revolution relates to other protest
  movements and revolutions that have occurred in the United States. We will
  have supplies available to use and staff will be present to assist as needed.


  No registration is required to attend; drop-ins encouraged. Stay for as little
  or as long as you'd like during the event.
