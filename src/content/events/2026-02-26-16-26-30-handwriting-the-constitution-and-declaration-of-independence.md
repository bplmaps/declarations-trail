title: Handwriting the Constitution and Declaration of Independence
snippet: >-
  In honor of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, visitors
  are invited to handwrite the Declaration and the US Constitution in the
  Courtyard of the Central Library in Copley Square. This program aims to create
  time and a quiet space to reflect and deepen one's understanding of these
  historic documents. 


  All supplies will be provided. Participants will first stop by the supply
  table to pick up writing supplies and copies of the Constitution and/or
  Declaration of Independence. Reproductions of John Adams's personal copy of
  the Constitution held by Special Collections will also be available to
  transcribe. 


  This program is self-paced. Patrons are invited to stay for the whole session
  or simply stay as long as they would like.
