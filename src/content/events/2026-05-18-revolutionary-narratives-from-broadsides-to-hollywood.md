title: "Revolutionary Narratives: From Broadsides to Hollywood"
snippet: >-
  From the Civil War to the Cold War and newsrooms to Hollywood, Americans looked to
  the Revolutionary era to debate and define what it meant to be an American,
  with often divisive results. Now, during the 250th anniversary of the
  Revolution, Jordan Taylor and Michael Hattem will examine commentary in
  Revolutionary-era newspapers and broadsides, consider how understanding of
  American independence has changed over time, and reflect on how the public
  sees the nation's founding today.
