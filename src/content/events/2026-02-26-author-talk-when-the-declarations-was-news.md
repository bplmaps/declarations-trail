snippet: >-
  Publishing for the 250th anniversary of the United States, When the
  Declaration of Independence Was News

  focuses on the nation’s founding document at the moment of its creation in
  1776, before anyone knew what the legacy of the Declaration would be or if the
  United States would win the war against Great Britain. It explores how the
  Declaration was communicated to people in the new nation and around the
  Atlantic world and reveals the stories of the many people involved in the
  process of declaring independence, from printers

  to soldiers to diplomats to translators.
